# Exercise 1: Proto Messages (15 min)

## Goal

Define the remaining proto messages in `chat.proto`.
`MessageRequest` is already filled in as an example — study it, then define the rest.

## Example (already done)

```proto
message MessageRequest {
  string room_id = 1;
  string user    = 2;
  string content = 3;
}
```

## Your task

Define these four messages (field names and types are in the comments in the file):

| Message | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `MessageResponse` | returned after a successful `SendMessage` |
| `Message` | the stored chat message (returned by `GetHistory` / `Chat`) |
| `HistoryRequest` | request history for a room |
| `BulkResponse` | returned after a bulk upload |
